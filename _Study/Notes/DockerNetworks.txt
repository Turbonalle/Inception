	7 TYPES OF DOCKER NETWORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. THE DEFAULT BRIDGE

	COMMAND	

	DRIVER	bridge

	- Creates a network between containers
	- Does not connect host to server container by default (need to EXPOSE)


2. THE USER-DEFINED BRIDGE

	COMMAND	docker network create my-network-name
	
	DRIVER	bridge

	- the network is isolated from the default network
	- lets you isolate your workloads
	- lets you ping other containers by name instead of ip addresses (addresses might change, but names do not)


3. THE HOST

	COMMAND	docker run -itd --rm --network host --name my-server-container nginx
	
	DRIVER	

	- uses the same network as the host
	- no need for exposing ports
	- lets container run as a regular application on the host despite being a container
	- downside: no isolation


4. THE macVLAN

	COMMAND	docker network create -d macvlan \
			--subnet X.X.X.X/X \
			--gateway X.X.X.X \
			-o parent=my-network-interface \
			my-created-network-name
	
	DRIVER	macvlan

	- connects containers directly to your physical network
	- gives containers their own Mac addresses
	- gives containers their own ip addresses on your network
